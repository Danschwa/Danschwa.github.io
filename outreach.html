<!-- Intro text -->
  <p>As our project’s aspirations, manpower and resources have grown, so has our ability to give back to the community. It is our belief that as a collegiate engineering organization we can make the greatest social impact by working with local educators and so we have formed an outreach team dedicated to inspiring youth and promoting the STEM fields by sharing our love of rocketry and engineering. To learn more about our past events and outreach capabilities, please read the descriptions below and feel free to contact our Vice President or outreach director for more information.

<b>Visit to New West Charter School | 4-12-2018 and 4-13-2018</b><br>
Collaborators: New West Charter School<br>
Special thanks to: Mr. Sigler, Christopher Vincent<br>
<br>
Over the course of two school days, a small group of our volunteers gave a presentation to 8th grade students about the basics of rocketry and how to use Newton’s Laws to analyze rocket flight. The students were at the conclusion of a unit focused on building rockets and introducing physics, so this was a great opportunity to take the information about rockets they were provided one step further.

<b>Visit to Marina Del Rey Middle School | 2-28-2018</b><br>
Collaborators: Bruin Partners, UCLA Newsroom, Lux Lab at UCLA<br>
Special thanks to: Sebastian Hernandez, Christopher Vincent<br>
<br>
This event was a collaboration with Bruin Partners, a UCLA student group that visits the school multiple times each week to mentor and tutor twenty struggling students between grades six and eight after school. In the school’s library we interactively presented about rocketry and engineering, showing the students that STEM can be exciting and fun. Leading up to the event, we worked with the UCLA Lux Lab to print launchable and modular rocket kits. Groups of three students chose their parts and were instructed about the building and launching process. The UCLA Newsroom filmed the visit itself, as well as much of the planning and preparation leading up to the visit. Interviews were conducted before, during, and after the event with Caleb, Chris, John, and two of the middle school students.

<b>Society of Women Engineers “Wow! That’s Engineering!” Day | 2-24-2018</b><br>
Collaborators: Society of Women Engineers - UCLA Chapter<br>

 <img style="padding:25px;" class="img-responsive center-block" src="Images/outreach_SWE.JPG" width="810" height="540">


This small event consisted of an hour and a half long tabling session in the Court of Sciences. During this time, we handed out fliers that explained what our organization does and spoke to the young visiting Girl Scouts about how exciting it is to be an engineering student. Though a short event, this was a great opportunity for our team to talk individually and inspire a great group of aspiring scientists and engineers!

<b>Visit to Scott Avenue Elementary School | 11-28-2018</b><br>
Collaborators: Lux Lab at UCLA, Scott Avenue Elementary School<br>
Special thanks to: Ms. Danoff, Dr. Daniel Pineda<br>
<br>
For this event we worked with Mrs. Danoff's fifth grade class of just under thirty students. We gave a short presentation on what it means to be a powerful problem solver, and then we launched a small 3D printed rocket as a demonstration. After this there was a hands on activity where small teams completed three separate tasks: crafting a weight-holding boat out of just aluminum foil, building a paper airplane to fly as far as possible, and using spaghetti and marshmallows to construct the tallest tower. After finishing with the class, each of the other three fifth grade classrooms were briefly visited as well.

<b>STEAM Exposition | 8-19-2017</b><br>
Collaborators: National College Resources Foundation<br>
Special thanks to: Dr. Daniel Pineda, Dr. Theresa Price<br>
<br>
This short event was held at a community college/trade school in Los Angeles and catered to young students ranging from elementary to high school age. Our group brought some rockets and equipment and spoke to young students about our passion for STEM and what the Rocket Project at UCLA does.

  <p><em> "...space is for everybody. It's not just for a few people in science or math, or for a select group of astronauts. <br>That's our new frontier out there, and it's everybody's business to know about space." - Christa McAuliffe</em></p>
  <p> We are a collegiate-level engineering team under the UCLA chapter of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. We focus on rocketry in all its aspects and combine nearly every discipline of engineering in our designs. At UCLA Rocket Project, we build to innovate. We are not satisfied with the ordinary and routine - we push the boundaries of our designs. Our passion and our goal is to one day launch our own rockets to space. </p>
